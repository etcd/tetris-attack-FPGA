# tetris-attack-FPGA
This project is a hardware-accelerated tetris-attack clone, implemented in SystemVerilog, for the Altera Cyclone IV FPGA. It was developed using Quartus II v15, on the Altera DE2 development board.

This project was made in Fall 2016 for ECE 385 at the University of Illinois.

# Mechanics
